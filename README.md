# Vulnerability scanner with Nessus

Vulnerability management is continuously assessing your assets and discovering vulnerabilities remediating them to an acceptable risk and then restarting the process over and over again to make sure the risk in the whole organization is low or at an acceptable level.

We use VMWare to install VM and install Windows 10 ISO:

We download Nessus:

we choose Nessus Essentials.

We create a VM using the ISO with VMWare:

The VM is set up:

we get now the IP address:

we turn off the Firewall:

we type ping and the IP address:

![Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 13 03 15](https://github.com/redjules/Vulnerability-scanner/assets/106017493/97e4b5f5-9e4a-48b9-a96a-5d56ee4ad1db)

we go to Nessus and create a Basic Network Scan:

and target our VM's IP address:

and launch the scan:

we click on vulnerabilities:

Now we are going to enable the remote registry, which will allow the scanner to connect to this computer's registry and crawl thru the registry and look for insecure configurations:

we go to the Registry Editor and create a local account token filter policy

we restart the VM and go to Nessus again and add a credential:


![Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 13 13 06](https://github.com/redjules/Vulnerability-scanner/assets/106017493/634a83f2-760f-4c83-a5ac-4ccbfdbec141)

we run the scan and we have a different result:

![Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 13 14 01](https://github.com/redjules/Vulnerability-scanner/assets/106017493/0fcfcd40-1219-4387-a7f2-737c201bf69d)


With credentials, you discover more vulnerabilities!

In the Remediations section, you have suggestions to mitigate the vulnerabilities:

VPR Top Threats is what Tenable is recommending we prioritize to remediate:

As a 3rd scenario, we install now very deprecated software on the VM, like a very old version of Firefox and we are going to run another scan:

We have now 68 critical vulnerabilities!

![Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 13 23 33](https://github.com/redjules/Vulnerability-scanner/assets/106017493/dc7ca626-4358-4866-9696-ee2c89e51a9c)

in the Remediations they recommend upgrading the Firefox version:
